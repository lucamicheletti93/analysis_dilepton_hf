Scripts for PYTHIA simulations:

```cpp
simulateDmesJPsi.cc
```
simulated `PYTHIA` events and stores the relevant information in a `TTRee`

```bash
runDmesJPsi.sh
```
runs multiple instances of `simulateDmesJPsi.cc` in parallel

```python
produce_prediction_jpsidmes.py
```
produces histograms with preditions

Here a file with pregenerated events can be found: [TO BE ADDED]
